          Remember the first date we went i met you somewhere near dominos
          that was the first day i ever ate garlic bread and second time i
          ever ate pizza and also that chocolava cake, remember when we ate
          that all you rushed to pay when you saw me i was paying, you know
          i was not going to come that day coz mere paas actual m 1000rs hi
          the and mujhe utne se hi poore mahine ka petrol karna tha but idk
          kuch toh hua tha mujhe us din jo bss m aa gya then i saw a girl
          waiting for me near dominos in her college uniform short height,
          curvy, cute, choote choote lips same with those eyes chooti chooti
          but bohot sunder like damn. fir dominos se bahar nikalne k baad mene
          pucha apse ab kaha jana hai and you said idk, fir thodi der baad apne
          kaha ki gandhi park mein ek pineapple juice wali shop h, fir hum waha
          gaye but vo shop aaj tak ni mili jo wo pulp dalta hai juice mein but
          fir humne ek dusre ka haath pakad k poore gandhi park k 4-5 rounds
          lagaye apne baare main baatein kari itni saari cheezin share kari
          obviously aap itna bolti-rehti thi par mujhe bss vo sunne main itna
          maza aara tha fir hum log park se bahar nikle for idhar udhar ghumne lage
          then ek baba mile (you rember what he said right) bhagwaan tumhari jodi salamat rakhe
          and we both looked at each other and smiled and apne ussi time 10rs nikal k unko diye
          and i was like damn she is pretty,innocent,completly odd from this world.
          then humne kulfi khayi jiska pay bhi apne hi kiya coz mere p upi m hi the and you said
          the its okay thats called chivalry and i asked you whats that means? you said ki it
          means gentlemen behaviour that was something special about you, you started loving me
          in first sight. I never met someone with your energy, that aura that day was different.
          then we went to Chai sutta bar it was dusk already and we had our first chai remember
          we talked aboutso many things i was so focused on my goals because i never wants to end
          up being helpless,poor and unremembered and i saw that spark in your eyes that was saying
          dont worry i am always with you whatever you want , i will always be with you , it was
          loud and clear even if you never said but i knew that exact moment that u are a worthy wifey
          remember it was almost 7:35 and you asked me about the time ki hum time pahuch jayenge na ?
          and i said dont worry mai hu na. and we both had innocent laughed then i left you at gate 2
          and even when you were late already it was 8:05 approx but still you hugged me before going
          inside like u didnt wanted to go

          <h3>14/11/2022:</h3>
          it was children's day i remember the day we went to the park had our first kiss like
          not actual kiss but kind of you were always so full of joy, kind, happiness like you were always
          a happy kid chul bul bacchi bilkul and i wanted to be with you , you told me the last time we
          met ki mujhe sabne bss meri body k liye sex k liye approach kiya h sach hai ladke ese hi approach
          karte h but ye bhi sach h ki hamari first date m mujhe lust nahi love feel hua tha even second date,
          tum meri life main tab aayi thi jab m khud main pura tha kisi se bhi dil lagane se darta tha par i
          am happy mene dil us ladki se lagaya jisse mujhse sacha pyaar kiya even when i am writing this
          i want to just hug you and sleep next to you just by holding you want to feel those emotions coz
          i never those emotions ever in my life and i know infact you never felt all that before me to me
          you are always my first love and i will always love you haan manta hu mene bohot kuch bola h tumhe
          last mein m justify bhi ni kar sakta mera gussa mera ego bohot ghamand tha mujhe apne aap pe
          good looking , sexual energy , infact is baat ki mujhpe kafi lakiya line deti hain even meri
          girlfriend ki best friend tak kese kese hint deti hai but i swear on zeus palak mene vo
          cheezein jo tumhare sath feel ki hai vo kisi or k liye kabhi feel ni ki pyaar sirf tumse tha or hai
          sex ki iccha sirf tumse thi,or kya nahi mene bhi vo sapne dekhe hai palak ek family tumhare sath ,
          jaha 2 3 dog ho 2 bacche ladki or ek ladka , i dont know if i ever told you this but pata mein
          tumhe hamesha meri mummy jesi ho ye kyu bolta tha not doubt multiple reasons the but strongest
          reason tha ki mein jab ek din mummy k bagal m soya tha i saw i had a daughter in my dream and
          i saw that same exact dream with you when we sleep together for the first day remember
          jab paap aa gya the din m achanak or tum so rakhi thi mene uthaya? han ussi din.
          i know ye sab cheezein ab yaad karke koi matlb nahi h par mujhe ye pata hain ki
          agar hum sachmein ek dusre ki liye hi hain toh chahye kuch ho jaye aaj nahi toh kal hum ek honge hi
          haan manta hu mein late hu kaafi cheezein samjhne m kafi time laga mujhe par mujhe ye bhi pata hai ki
          mera or tumhara pyaar sacha tha galti ki hain maine mafi k layak nahi hu. par aaj bhi aas hai ki tum aayogi ek din zarur aogi
          bss us din ka intezaar hai. yaad hai jab last time mene gusse mein gaadho ki tarah vo cheezin likhi thi
          tab ek couple humare paas se guzra tha hamara gana play karte huye, palak bhale hi mein pehle
          show nahi karta tha ya apni insecurities ki wajah se show nahi kar pata tha par
          ye baat tu bhi janti hai mein tujhse bohot bohot bohot pyaar karta hu infact m words mein bol bhi nahi sakta or
          jitna jitna time badhte jara hai ye pyaar or badhte jara hai. toh mujh nahi pata tu meri hogi ya nahi par mein yahi hu
          jab bulaogi ajaunga or yahi pyaar hai palak mujhe pata hai tumhara main reason wapis na aane ka ye hai ki
          jo sabd mene tumhe messages m likhe the ki agar mein attach nahi hota bss attachment nahi to ye hota vo hota par nahi
          palak vo sab bss ego satisfy karne k liye tha mujhse bardaash nahi ho pa raha tha ki tum mere bina khush ho but
          mein bewakoof ye samjhne se hi mana kar diya ki tum kitna pyaar karti ho mujhse or
          tum nahi thi kush bss dikha rahi thi ki haan hain khush hu , I Love You palak mujhe pata hai tujhe samay chahiye or tera haq hai samay lena,
          i love you is baar tum aogi toh mein tumhe vo sab express karunga toh mujhe shuruat se karna chahiye tha ,
          mujhe toh 2nd time bhi pyaar ussi ladki se hua jisse first time hua tha.
