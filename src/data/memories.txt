/*yaad h jab hum first date p the gandhi park gye 
ek baba mile and unhone bola ki bhagwan tumhari 
jodi salamat rakhe and we were similing looking at each other 


jab last time mene vo sab cheeze kahi and i was crying in front 
of you like a baby and ek couple humare side se guzarta hai and 
our favourite song play karte huye the paas us to me it was a 
sign of god ki this is the girl you better regret than not trying*/
